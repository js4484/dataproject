# Data Project

### Background

This website will be an interactive presentation of art and artist data utilizing open source information from the Met Museum, the Harvard Art Musems, and other API sources.
Data will be presented with animations and charts (inspired by the Spotify year end wrap up), and a user will be able to click through, and choose between different parameters.
